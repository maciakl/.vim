# Deprecation Note

Around 2023 I switched to Neovim as my main editor. You can still use this as a template, but I likely won't be making many changes or updates.

Check out my [Neovim config](https://github.com/maciakl/neovim).

This is my current, juiced up IDE mode with LVM and Copilot.

For minimalistic .vimrc that I usually ssh into the servers, see [Minimalistic Vimrc](https://gist.github.com/maciakl/6e5c8021b6db6626deb12033d0f5d1a4).

My Personal Vim Settings
===

This is my personal git directory, under source control ready to be deployed
across across all platforms.

Sessions
--------

Sessions are automatically saved to `~/.vim/session` and you will be asked if 
you want to restore from an existing session if you open vim without a file
argument. Session names are created based on the `--servername` argument. The
default for gvim is `GVIM`. If you want to create a unique session you can do:

    :SessionName sessionname

Then launch vim with that session name to restore:

    gvim --servername sessioname

Note that sessions preserve environment. If you updated `.vimrc` or plugins you
will need to manually source them after launching. If your session just got 
weird, you can blow away everything other than the buffer and tab list by doing:

    :SessionCleanSave

This is the same as setting:

    :set sessionoptions=blank,buffers,curdir,tabpages

Then quit and re-launch to clean environment with the buffer list and arglist
intact.

Persistent Undo
---------------

Persistent undo is enabled if you are running 7.3 or above. All the undo files
are saved to `~/.vim/undo`. This directory may get somewhat large if you don't
blow it away every once in a while so watch for that.

Deploying
---

On Linux and Mac:

    rm -rf .vim
    rm .vimrc
    git clone git@github.com:maciakl/.vim.git
    ln -s .vim/.vimrc .vimrc
    cd .vim
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

On Windows:

    rmdir /s /q vimfiles
    del _vimrc
    git clone git@github.com:maciakl/.vim.git
    mklink /d vimfiles .vim
    mklink /h _vimrc .vim\.vimrc
    cd .vim
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

On Windows XP:

	rmdir /s /q vimfiles
    del _vimrc
    git clone git@github.com:maciakl/.vim.git
    junction vimfiles .vim
    fsutil hardlink create _vimrc .vim\.vimrc
    cd .vim
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Note that you will need [junction.exe](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx) from Sysinternals to create the symbolic link for the directory. The fsutil executable should be on your system by default.

Other Prerequisites
-------------------

Your vim should be compiled with `+dialog` and `+python`.

You may also need these:

- [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7/)
- [Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) 

You could probably use unix ctags, but they don't have all the features.

####CTAGS Ain't Hard!

On debians and buntus of all shapes and sizes:

    sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags
     
On windows download `ctags.exe` from the link above and put somewhere in your path.

Mac is a little trickier:

- Use [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) to install the package ctags. 
    
Then add this to `.basrc` or `.profile`:

    alias ctags="`brew --prefix`/bin/ctags"

# Lessons Learned

Here are some things that work or did not work:

- Git submodules are the worst way of managing dependencies
- Plugin management has improved a lot since the days of Pathogen
- Somehow `ctags` were always a major pain and most fragile element of the setup
- A lot of the extensions here broke, or became obsolete
- Having actual LVM support makes a lot of the plugins irrelevant
- Unite worked, but what I really wanted was [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
- Sessions were an interesting idea that I initally really liked and used, but then fell out of love with
